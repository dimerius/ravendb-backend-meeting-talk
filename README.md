# Demo for a presentation in Backend meeting

This presentation is a brief overview of some RavenDb features. The app is a console app, so we do not have to deal with the overhead of webserver. Please ignore the Console.Writeline, Console.Readkey methods. These are used just for convinience.

App demonstrates features - suggestions, search, map-reduce, subscriptions, indexes.
